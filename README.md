# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis
The purpose of this project was to aggregate student math and reading scores and analyze the data to uncover trends related to school spending, size, and type.  After an initial analysis, evidence of academic dishonesty among the ninth grade class at Thomas High School warrented a revised analysis, removing the affected scores and re-examining the data and trends.

### School Rankings
THS's school standing with the 9th scores included was second.  After removing the questionable scores, THS's remained as the second ranking school.

### Math and Reading Scores by Grade
When grouped by school, math and reading scores accross grade levels were stable, with the notable exception of no longer having data for the 9th grade class at THS.
